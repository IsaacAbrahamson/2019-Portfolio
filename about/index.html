        <h3>A little about me...</h3>
        <p>Hey! I'm Isaac. I'm a "professional" web developer and college student. I've always loved computers for as long as I can remember. I built a website when I was 10 in Microsoft Publisher and OneNote, and by the time I was fourteen, I was running my own Minecraft server with friends.</p>
        <p>I wrote my first program ever in C# on Christmas day 2014. Since then, I have taught myself how to build websites and have done professional work for people. I currently work as a Systems Analyst Intern at SPARK Business Works. That probably sounds a bit confusing so let me tell you what I do.</p>
        <p><a href="https://sparkbusinessworks.com">SPARK Business Works</a> builds mobile apps, dashboards, and workflow tools to make businesses better. Every night our developers in India write software for clients we have in the U.S. During the day, my responsibility is to QA their updates and make sure they do exactly what our client wants them to do.</p>
        <p>When a new project comes around, I get to take the ideas our client has and document wireframes and functionality for our developers to get started on. I also help out with other things when needed like updating servers. I'm fortunate to be in an awesome position where I get to interact with both businesses and developers around the world and try out many amazing software solutions.</p>
        <p>Right now I'm more busy with my computer science classes at school. Some of the coolest things I've done are build cross-platform apps and decode PNG files in binary.</p>

        <h3>Some things I like to do...</h3>
        <p>Play video games. Some of my favorites have been Minecraft, Mario, World of Tanks, Rocket League, Fortnite, and Overwatch. I also enjoy indie games and pretty much anything that is competitive.</p>
        <p>Play music. I am a pretty good pianist and trumpet player. I won first place in the MAACS brass solo competition two years in a row in trumpet, and I've performed piano pieces and concerts for nursing homes and churches. In high school I played trumpet every summer in a regional band which was tons of fun as well.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the outdoors. One of the benefits of living in small-town Iowa is that you get to see great stars at night. I love going over to my friend's house in the country and watching the milky way and meteor showers. My family also owns three kayaks and almost every summer my Dad and I visit my uncle in Wisconsin to explore nature together.</p>
        <p>Travel. Between business trips with my Dad and family vacations, I've been all over the United States to see diferent museums, national parks, and corporations. Some of my favorite places are Chicago, Air and Space Smithsonian in D.C., Zion National Park, and Yellowstone. </p>
